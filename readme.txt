An easy way to set up A/B Testing Campaigns using Gutenberg blocks, and to get the conversion rates for each variation.

== Description ==

An easy way to set up A/B Testing Campaigns using Gutenberg blocks, and to get the conversion rates for each variation.

This plugin allows content managers and marketing teams to create A/B testing campaigns. This plugin works great whether your need to test a simple color change in a single button or if you need to compare conversion rates between complex block patternsâ€¦ and even between full landing pages!

**My WP A/B Testing** works better when [Reusable Block Extended](https://wordpress.org/plugins/reusable-blocks-extended) is also installed, as it technically uses Reusable Blocks to build your A/B Testing campaigns.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin and activate it in your WordPress Admin.
2. Go to A/B Testing Admin Menu.
3. Create your first A/B Testing campaign.
4. Insert your A/B Testing campaign into your posts and pages.
5. Get instant conversion rates for each variation of your campaign.

== Changelog ==
